	iOS Network Monitoring
===========================================

This script allows the perpetator to monitor all data on iOS unencrypted by installing
an invisible infected ipa which looks at all unencrypted incoming and outgoing data
and can be monitored using msfvenom or metasploit. It will log all usernames and passwords
entered and saved by the user. It will check all apps on the phone, safari, and chrome browser (if applicable)
for saved information and send it to the loot folder as well.

MUST HAVE A FEMALE USB TO LIGHTNING FOR THIS TO WORK
