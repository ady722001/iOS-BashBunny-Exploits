# Title:         iSploit Monitor
# Description:   
#                This script allows the perpetator to monitor all data on iOS unencrypted by installing
#                an invisible infected ipa which looks at all unencrypted incoming and outgoing data
#                and can be monitored using msfvenom or metasploit. It will log all usernames and passwords
#                entered and saved by the user. It will check all apps on the phone, safari, and chrome browser (if applicable)
#                for saved information and send it to the loot folder as well.
